## My Beginnings with PCOS

Before I received my diagnosis, I considered my experience with female health  
to be quite typical. I had regular check-ups, followed standard health  
practices, and never thought much about my reproductive health beyond  
the usual concerns. I felt a sense of normalcy, believing that everything  
was functioning as it should. However, that perspective changed  
dramatically once I faced the diagnosis, which forced me to reevaluate  
my understanding of my health and wellbeing. My journey with PCOS began  
about six months after I gave birth to my daughter. I noticed a rapid  
weight gain that made me wonder if I might be pregnant again. After a  
wellness check-up and a pregnancy test, I was relieved to find out that  
I wasn't pregnant, but I was still confused about why my weight was  
increasing despite my commitment to diet and exercise. 

Over the next ten years, I saw numerous doctors, but each one simply  
advised me to monitor my eating and exercise more. This was incredibly  
frustrating because I was genuinely making an effort to improve my health  
but saw no results. In another attempt to seek answers, I met with a new  
OBGYN who conducted more blood tests. During my follow-up appointment  
with her, she ultimately diagnosed me with PCOS.

At the time, many healthcare providers were still learning about the  
condition and typically prescribed birth control and metformin.  
Although I took the medications, I still felt that something was not  
quite right. Despite my ongoing treatment, I struggled to regain my  
health. Years of countless doctor visits, blood tests, and ultrasounds  
provided me with no clear answers. If you're one of the many women who

numerous symptoms associated with it, you've come to the right place.
