These hormones play a crucial role in maintaining hormonal balance within the body. By regulating menstrual cycles, they help ensure that ovulation occurs regularly, which can alleviate symptoms of hormonal imbalances. Additionally, these hormones are effective in reducing acne, as they lower the levels of androgensâ€”male hormones that can contribute to increased oil production in the skin. Furthermore, by decreasing androgen production, these hormones can significantly minimize excessive hair growth in areas where it may be unwanted (a condition known as hirsutism), providing both cosmetic and emotional benefits. Overall, their multifaceted functions support not just physical well-being, but also confidence and quality of life for those affected by hormonal imbalances (Migala, 2022).
