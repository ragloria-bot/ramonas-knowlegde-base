## Regulate Insulin Levels

Metformin is frequently prescribed to individuals diagnosed with  
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder  
that affects women of reproductive age. This medication helps  
manage insulin levels and improve metabolic function, which  
can alleviate some of the symptoms associated with PCOS, such  
as irregular menstrual cycles and weight gain. Additionally,  
metformin may support fertility in women experiencing  
difficulties due to this condition and consider  
[[Fertility Medications]] to work along side. For some, Metformin  
enhances the bodyâ€™s ability to utilize insulin more  
effectively, which can lead to improvements in menstrual  
cycle regularity and overall hormonal balance. Additionally,  
it may facilitate weight loss by promoting better metabolic  
responses to food intake and reducing insulin resistance,  
making it easier for the body to manage blood sugar levels.  
These benefits can contribute to improved reproductive  
health and overall well-being (Migala, 2022).
