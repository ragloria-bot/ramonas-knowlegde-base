## Planning for a Family

For those trying to conceive, medications like clomiphene  
citrate play an essential role in stimulating ovulation.  
This oral medication is particularly beneficial for women  
diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition  
that can significantly impact fertility. Women with PCOS  
often face challenges related to irregular menstrual cycles  
and hormonal imbalances, making it more difficult to conceive.  
As a result, navigating fertility becomes one of the most  
challenging aspects of living with this condition, especially  
for those who desire to have children. By working closely with  
a healthcare provider, individuals can explore various treatment  
options to enhance their chances of conception and achieve  
their family planning goals (HealthPartners, 2025).
