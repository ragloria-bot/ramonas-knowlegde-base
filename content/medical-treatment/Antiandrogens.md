Antiandrogen medications work by blocking the effects of  
androgensâ€”male hormones that can influence various skin  
conditions. By reducing androgen activity in the skin,  
they can effectively help manage issues such as excessive  
hair growth (hirsutism) and acne. This mechanism not only  
diminishes unwanted hair but also helps to reduce oil  
production and prevent clogged pores, leading to clearer  
skin. These treatments paired with [[Oral Contraceptives]]  
are often part of a comprehensive approach to address  
hormonal imbalances, particularly in conditions like  
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where such skin  
issues are common (Mayo Foundation, 2022).
