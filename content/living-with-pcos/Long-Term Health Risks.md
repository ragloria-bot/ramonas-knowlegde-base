## Cardiovascular Health

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) face an elevated risk of developing  
several cardiovascular health issues, including high blood pressure  
(hypertension), elevated cholesterol levels, and heart disease. PCOS is a  
hormonal disorder that can lead to insulin resistance, which in turn may  
contribute to metabolic syndrome—a cluster of conditions that increase the  
risk of heart disease and other serious health complications. Research suggests  
that the hormonal imbalances and metabolic challenges associated with PCOS can  
significantly impact cardiovascular health, making it crucial for individuals  
with this condition to monitor their heart health, maintain a balanced diet,  
[[Lifestyle Changes]] , engage in regular physical activity, and work closely 
with healthcare providers to manage these risks effectively.

due to factors like insulin resistance and elevated cholesterol levels.*

### Mental Health

Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) often experience emotional distress,  
depression, and anxiety as a result of the various physical and hormonal changes  
associated with the condition. These mental health challenges can significantly  
impact their quality of life, relationships, and overall well-being. It's essential  
for individuals facing these symptoms to have open and honest conversations with  
their healthcare provider. Together, they can explore effective treatment options,  
which may include therapy, lifestyle modifications, or medication, to help manage  
these emotional struggles [[Mental Health and Support]]. Addressing these concerns  
is crucial for holistic care and can lead to a better understanding of both the  
physical and emotional aspects of living with PCOS.

##### When to seek help when you are feeling:

- More emotional than usual
- depression lasting more a few days
- unusal physical changes

#### Endometrial Cancer

If you experience irregular periods or have not had a period for an extended time, it  
can increase the thickness of the uterine lining, raising the risk of developing  
endometrial cancer. This thickening occurs because the lining does not shed regularly.  
Fortunately, there are various treatments available that can help regulate your  
menstrual cycles, reducing the risk of complications and promoting overall reproductive  
health. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider to explore these options.
