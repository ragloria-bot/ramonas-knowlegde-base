## Medications

In addition to traditional birth control methods, certain medications used in the  
management of diabetes, such as metformin, have been found to be effective in  
addressing insulin resistance. Metformin works by improving the body's sensitivity  
to insulin, which can lead to lower insulin levels and a reduction in circulating  
androgen levels. This is particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing hormonal  
imbalances, as high androgen levels can contribute to various health issues, including  
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). By targeting both insulin resistance and androgen  
production, metformin can play a crucial role in improving overall hormonal balance  
and [[Managing Symptoms]].

##### Why Are Hormonal Pills Commonly Prescribed for PCOS?

- Irregular ovulation (or no ovulation at all)
- Elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels
- Excess testosterone in circulation

### Infertility Treatment

If you are trying to conceive, your doctor may recommend a variety of approaches  
tailored to your specific situation. These could include medication to regulate  
your hormonal levels, improve ovulation, or address underlying health issues  
that may be affecting fertility. In addition to medical treatments, your healthcare  
provider might suggest [[Lifestyle Changes]] such as adopting a balanced diet,  
maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and reducing stress, all of  
which can positively influence your chances of becoming pregnant. For couples  
facing more significant challenges, in-vitro fertilization (IVF) may be considered  
as a viable option. This advanced reproductive technology involves extracting eggs  
and sperm to create embryos in a laboratory, which are then implanted in the uterus.  
Ultimately, your doctor will work with you to develop a personalized plan that  
considers both your health and your desire to start or expand your family.
