## Stabilizing Sugar Levels

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal  
disorder that frequently occurs in women of reproductive  
age and is commonly linked to insulin resistance. Insulin  
resistance occurs when the body's cells fail to respond  
efficiently to insulin, leading to elevated levels of  
insulin and glucose in the bloodstream. This metabolic  
imbalance can contribute to various symptoms associated  
with PCOS, including weight gain, irregular menstrual  
cycles, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

To help manage insulin resistance, it is crucial to  
focus on a diet that includes foods with a low glycemic  
index (GI) and are the [[Benefits of Diet and Exercise for PCOS]].  
Low-GI foods, such as whole grains, legumes,  
fruits, and non-starchy vegetables, release sugar more  
slowly into the bloodstream. This slower release helps  
stabilize blood sugar levels and reduces the demand for  
insulin, which can improve overall insulin sensitivity.

Incorporating these foods into your daily meals not only  
supports better insulin management but also contributes  
to a balanced and nutritious diet. By emphasizing low-GI  
options, individuals with PCOS can take proactive steps  
toward managing their symptoms and improving their  
long-term health (Catalyst, 2024).

### Counteract High Insulin

Effectively managing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)  
involves regulating insulin levels, which play a crucial  
role in the condition. High insulin levels can stimulate  
the production of androgens, the male hormones that are  
often elevated in individuals with PCOS. This increase in  
androgen levels can contribute to a range of symptoms,  
including irregular menstrual cycles, acne, and excessive  
hair growth. Furthermore, elevated insulin can make weight  
loss more difficult, as it promotes fat storage and can  
lead to increased cravings for sugary and high-carbohydrate  
foods. Therefore, focusing on strategies to balance  
insulin—such as dietary changes, regular exercise, and,  
in some cases, medication—can be essential for improving  
overall health and alleviating the symptoms of PCOS (Vergis, 2024).
