## Physical Activity is Key

Regular physical activity plays a crucial role in managing  
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Engaging in consistent  
exercise helps improve insulin sensitivity, which is often  
impaired in individuals with PCOS. This improvement can lead  
to better blood sugar control and a reduced risk of developing  
type 2 diabetes. In addition, physical activity helps regulate  
hormone levels, which can alleviate many symptoms associated  
with PCOS, such as irregular menstrual cycles and weight gain.  
Incorporating a mix of aerobic exercises, strength training,  
and flexibility workouts can provide comprehensive benefits,  
promoting not only physical health but also mental well-being.  
Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise  
each week to support your overall health and effectively  
manage PCOS (Women's Health of Central Virginia, 2024).

- **Engage in Regular Moderate Exercise:** Aim for a minimum  
of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week.  
Activities such as walking, cycling, or swimming are excellent  
choices to keep you active.  

- **Include Strength Training:** Building muscle not only boosts  
your metabolism but also helps stabilize blood sugar levels,  
contributing to your overall health.  

- **Incorporate Gentle, Stress-Reducing Activities:** Practices like  
yoga and Pilates can effectively help manage stress, reduce cortisol  
levels, and enhance insulin sensitivity.  

- **Prioritize Healthy Weight Loss:** For those who are overweight,  
losing even a small percentage of body weight (5â€“10%) can have a   
significant impact on improving symptoms and restoring ovulation
