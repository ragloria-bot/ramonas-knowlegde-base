## Practice Makes Perfect

Chronic stress and inadequate sleep can significantly worsen  
the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by disrupting  
the delicate balance of hormones in the body. When a person  
experiences ongoing stress, the body produces higher levels of  
cortisol, the stress hormone, which can interfere with the  
normal functioning of other hormones related to menstrual  
regulation and ovulation. Additionally, poor sleep can lead  
to imbalances in other hormones, such as insulin and androgens,  
which are crucial in managing PCOS. As a result, individuals  
may experience increased symptoms like irregular periods,  
weight gain, and mood swings, highlighting the importance  
of stress management and proper sleep hygiene for those  
affected by PCOS (LoginUser, 2025).

- **Practice mindfulness**: Meditation, deep breathing  
exercises, and guided imagery can help calm the mind and  
lower cortisol levels.  

- **Prioritize sleep hygiene**: Aim for 7â€“8 hours of sleep  
per night. Establish a consistent routine, avoid electronics  
before bed, and create a restful environment.  

- **Engage in relaxation techniques**: Activities like journaling,  
aromatherapy, [[Acupuncture]] or spending time in nature can help  
reduce stress and improve mental well-being.  

- **Limit stressors**: Identify and set boundaries around sources 
of stress in your life. Seek professional counseling, such as cognitive-behavioral  
therapy (CBT), if stress becomes overwhelming (LoginUser, 2025).
