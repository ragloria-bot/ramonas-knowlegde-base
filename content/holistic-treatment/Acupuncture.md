## ## Chinese medicine and PCOS

Acupuncture is a complementary therapy that can effectively support  
the management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). This ancient  
practice involves the insertion of fine needles at specific points  
on the body to help restore balance and improve overall well-being.  
By regulating hormonal levels, acupuncture can address some of the  
underlying issues associated with PCOS, such as irregular menstrual  
cycles and insulin resistance. Additionally, acupuncture is known to  
enhance blood circulation, which can promote healthier ovarian  
function and improve metabolic health. Furthermore, by promoting  
relaxation and reducing stress levels, this therapy can provide  
significant emotional support for those coping with the challenges  
of PCOS. Overall, acupuncture offers a holistic approach to managing  
symptoms and improving quality of life for individuals affected by  
this condition (2025).
