## Chinese medicine and PCOS

Acupuncture is a complementary therapy that can effectively support  
the management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). This ancient  
practice involves the insertion of fine needles at specific points  
on the body to help restore balance, improve overall well-being, and  
[[Stress and Sleep Management]]. By regulating hormonal levels,  
acupuncture can address some of the underlying issues associated  
with PCOS, such as irregular menstrual cycles and insulin  
resistance. Additionally, acupuncture is known to enhance blood  
circulation, which can promote healthier ovarian function and  
improve metabolic health. Furthermore, by promoting relaxation  
and reducing stress levels, this therapy can provide significant  
emotional support for those coping with the challenges of PCOS.  
Overall, acupuncture offers a holistic approach to managing  
symptoms and improving quality of life for individuals affected by  
this condition (2025).
