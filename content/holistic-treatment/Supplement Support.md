## Herbal Supplements

Certain herbs, dietary supplements, and [[Anti-Inflammatory Foods]]  
have demonstrated potential benefits in alleviating symptoms of  
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), particularly those related to  
insulin resistance and hormonal imbalances. For example, supplements  
such as inositol, spearmint tea, and omega-3 fatty acids may support  
metabolic health and improve hormonal regulation. However, it is  
essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new  
supplement regimen. This is crucial because dietary supplements are  
not regulated by the FDA, which means their safety, efficacy, and  
quality can vary significantly. Additionally, some supplements may  
interact with prescription medications or exacerbate existing health  
conditions. Therefore, a tailored approach supervised by a healthcare  
professional is advisable to ensure the best outcomes for managing  
PCOS (Watson, 2023).
