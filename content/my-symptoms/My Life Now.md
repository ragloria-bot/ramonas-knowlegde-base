## Glass Full Not Empty

Reflecting on the past 20 years since my initial diagnosis,  
I can honestly say that my overall quality of life has  
improved tremendously. While I still experience some  
lingering symptoms, I have learned to embrace them as  
part of my identity rather than letting them define me.  
They have shaped me into the woman, wife, and mother  
I am today.

Health-wise, I feel significantly better and more  
comfortable in my own skin. In 2023, I made a pivotal  
decision to reclaim my life from the grasp of PCOS.  
Instead of allowing it to dictate my journey or hold  
me back from achieving my aspirations, I chose to  
focus on what truly matters—living fully and pursuing  
my goals with determination and passion.

I’ve discovered that life is about making the best of  
our circumstances. With or without a diagnosis, it’s  
in our power to create a fulfilling existence. Every  
step I’ve taken towards improving my health and  
well-being has strengthened my resolve to live life  
on my own terms. I am committed to embracing my  
journey and encouraging others to do the same,  
proving that we can find joy and purpose regardless  
of the challenges we face.
