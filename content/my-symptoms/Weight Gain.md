## Losing Weight Felt Impossible

Before I was officially diagnosed with polycystic  
ovary syndrome (PCOS), I experienced a dramatic  
increase in my weight shortly after the birth of  
my daughter. Despite my efforts to manage my health,  
I found myself struggling with an uphill battle  
against my body. I adopted a low-carb diet,  
dedicating countless hours to cardio workouts at  
the gym, hoping to shed the extra pounds. I would  
commit to this lifestyle change for several months,  
but it was disheartening to see no tangible results. 

Each visit to my doctor added to my frustration, as  
I repeatedly heard the same advice: I needed to  
change my lifestyle. While I understood the importance  
of healthy habits, I felt stuck in a cycle of dedication  
and disappointment. My physician prescribed Metformin,  
which was supposed to assist with my insulin resistance,  
a common issue associated with PCOS. Unfortunately,  
the medication did not yield the results I had hoped  
for and left me feeling even more defeated. 

For a staggering 17 years, I fought a persistent battle  
with weight gain, which weighed heavily on both my physical  
and emotional well-being. In 2023, I hit my highest weight  
of 310 lbs., a turning point that left me feeling hopeless  
and ready to give up on seeking medical treatment altogether.  
I was overwhelmed and disheartened, feeling like I  
had exhausted all options.

However, one night, feeling desperate for answers, I decided  
to delve back into research to find specialists in PCOS. This  
led me to a nurse practitioner who truly understood the   
complexities of the condition. She took the time to conduct  
comprehensive hormonal blood work and listened to my concerns  
with empathy and expertise. With her help, I received tailored  
prescriptions that addressed my unique challenges, more  
effectively than any physician I had consulted in the  
past two decades.

With this newfound support, combined with a renewed focus on  
diet and exercise, I embarked on a transformative journey.  
Over time, I began to see real progress, and I have  
successfully lost over 100 lbs. This experience has not only  
improved my physical health but has also renewed my faith  
in my ability to take control of [[My Life Now]] and well-being.
