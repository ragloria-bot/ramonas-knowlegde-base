## Thinning Hair 

Losing my hair has been a deeply challenging experience,  
as it is a significant part of my identity and how I see  
myself. My hair was one of the first things that attracted  
my husband, and as I experienced this loss, I couldn't help  
but feel less attractive and unsure about my appearance.  
This shift has not only affected my self-esteem but also  
added a layer of emotional complexity to my relationship,  
as I delt with how I perceive myself versus how he sees me.

Despite my extensive experience consulting with various  
doctors and undergoing countless blood tests, each medical  
professional has consistently reported that all my results  
come back normal. With that in mind, I find it perplexing  
and concerning that I'm experiencing significant hair loss.  
How can such a drastic change in my health, like losing  
large amounts of hair, be considered normal when all my  
tests indicate that everything is functioning properly?  
This discrepancy has left me searching for answers  
and feeling frustrated.
